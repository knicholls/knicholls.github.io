<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(68, 68, 68)"><strong>Etta, Otto, Russell and James by Emma Hopper<br /></strong></span><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">Etta's greatest unfulfilled wish, living in the rolling farmland of Saskatchewan, is to see the sea. And so, at the age of eighty-two she gets up very early one morning, takes a rifle, some chocolate, and her best boots, and begins walking the 2,000 miles to water.</span><span style="color:rgb(68, 68, 68)"><strong><br /><br />&#8203;In Winter I Get Up at Night by Jane Urquhart</strong></span><br /><span style="color:rgb(49, 49, 49)">In the early morning dark, Emer McConnell rises for a day of teaching music in the schools of rural Saskatchewan. While she travels the snowy roads in the gathering light, she begins another journey, one of recollection and introspection, and one that, through the course of Jane Urquhart&rsquo;s brilliant new novel, will leave the reader forever changed.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(68, 68, 68)"><strong>The Thursday Murder Club by Richard Osman</strong><br />The Thursday Murder Club is an intelligent mystery about a group of senior citizens who find themselves in the centre of a murder investigation.&nbsp;<br />Every Thursday, Elizabeth, Joyce, Ibrahim and Ron, residents of Coopers Chase Retirement Village, meet to review cold case murder files.<br /><br /><strong>Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver</strong></span><br /><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">Set in the mountains of southern Appalachia, this is the story of a boy born to a teenaged single mother in a single-wide trailer, with no assets beyond his dead father's good looks and copper-colored hair, a caustic wit, and a fierce talent for survival.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(68, 68, 68)"><strong>The Great Alone by Kristin Hannah</strong></span><br /><span style="color:rgb(71, 64, 57)">Ernt Allbright, a former POW, comes home from the Vietnam war a changed and volatile man. When he loses yet another job, he makes an impulsive decision: he will move his family north, to Alaska, where they will live off the grid in America&rsquo;s last true frontier.</span><br /><br /><strong>In the Blink of an Eye by Jo Callaghan</strong><br /><span style="color:rgb(68, 68, 68)">A missing persons case becomes personal for DCS Kat Frank, who works with AIDE Lock, an artificial intelligence detective.</span><br /><br /><strong>Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmas</strong><br />Chemist Elizabeth Zott is not your average woman. In fact, Elizabeth Zott would be the first to point out that there is no such thing as an&nbsp;average&nbsp;woman. But it's the early 1960s and her all-male team at Hastings Research Institute takes a very unscientific view of equality. Except for one: Calvin Evans, the lonely, brilliant, Nobel Prize&ndash;nominated grudge holder who falls in love with&mdash;of all things&mdash;her mind. True chemistry results.<br /><br /><strong>&ldquo;Outsider&rdquo; by Brett Popplewell</strong><br />&nbsp;Outsider&nbsp;follows journalist Brett Popplewell as he uncovers the story of Dag Aabye, an aging former stuntman who lived alone inside a school bus on a mountain, running day and night through blizzards and heat waves. The book chronicles Aabye's life from childhood to the silver screen, reflecting on our notions of aging, belonging and human accomplishment.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="color:rgb(15, 17, 17); font-weight:bold">Talking to Strangers&nbsp;by Malcolm Gladwell.</span><br /><span>Malcolm Gladwell, host of the podcast&nbsp;</span><span>Revisionist History</span><span>&nbsp;and author of the #1&nbsp;</span><span>New York Times</span><span>&nbsp;bestseller&nbsp;</span><span>Outliers</span><span>, offers a powerful examination of our interactions with strangers,&nbsp;and why they often go wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">The Dressmakers of Auschwitz</font></strong><br />The tale of surviving the &ldquo;hideous anomaly&rdquo; of a fashion salon run by Hedwig H&ouml;ss, the commandant&rsquo;s wife.<br />Adlington, a British fashion historian, digs into the stories of &ldquo;seamstresses who defied Nazi attempts to dehumanize and degrade them by forming the most incredible bonds of friendship and loyalty.<br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">Klara and the Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro</font></strong><br /><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">From her place in the store, Klara, an Artificial Friend with outstanding observational qualities, watches carefully the behavior of those who come in to browse, and of those who pass on the street outside. She remains hopeful that a customer will soon choose her, but when the possibility emerges that her circumstances may change forever, Klara is warned not to invest too much in the promises of humans.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">In&nbsp;</span><em style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">Klara and the Sun</em><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">, Kazuo Ishiguro looks at our rapidly changing modern world through the eyes of an unforgettable narrator to explore a fundamental question: what does it mean to love?</span><br /><br /><font><strong style="color:rgb(76, 118, 162)">The Midnight&nbsp;Library&nbsp;by Matt Haig&nbsp;</strong></font><br /><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets? A novel about all the choices that go into a life well lived.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.<br />&#8203;</span><br /><span><font color="#4c76a2"><strong>The Orenda by Joseph Boyden</strong>&nbsp;</font></span><br /><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">In the remote winter landscape a brutal massacre and the kidnapping of a young Iroquois girl violently re-ignites a deep rift between two tribes. The girl&rsquo;s captor, Bird, is one of the Huron Nation&rsquo;s great warriors and statesmen. Years have passed since the murder of his family, and yet they are never far from his mind. In the girl, Snow Falls, he recognizes the ghost of his lost daughter, but as he fights for her heart and allegiance, small battles erupt into bigger wars as both tribes face a new, more dangerous threat from afar.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">Traveling with the Huron is Christophe, a charismatic missionary who has found his calling among the tribe and devotes himself to learning and understanding their customs and language. An emissary from distant lands, he brings much more than his faith to this new world, with its natural beauty and riches.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">As these three souls dance with each other through intricately woven acts of duplicity, their social, political and spiritual worlds collide - and&nbsp; new nation rises from a world in flux.</span><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">The Sleeping Car Porter by Suette Mayr</font></strong><br /><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">The Sleeping Car Porter brings to life an important part of Black history in North America, from the perspective of a queer man living in a culture that renders him invisible in two ways. Affecting, imaginative, and visceral enough that you&rsquo;ll feel the rocking of the train, The Sleeping Car Porter is a stunning accomplishment.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">Baxter&rsquo;s name isn&rsquo;t George. But it&rsquo;s 1929, and Baxter is lucky enough, as a Black man, to have a job as a sleeping car porter on a train that crisscrosses the country. So when the passengers call him George, he has to just smile and nod and act invisible. What he really wants is to go to dentistry school, but he&rsquo;ll have to save up a lot of nickel and dime tips to get there, so he puts up with &ldquo;George.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">On this particular trip out west, the passengers are more unruly than usual, especially when the train is stalled for two extra days; their secrets start to leak out and blur with the sleep-deprivation hallucinations Baxter is having. When he finds a naughty postcard of two queer men, Baxter&rsquo;s memories and longings are reawakened; keeping it puts his job in peril, but he can&rsquo;t part with the postcard or his thoughts of Edwin Drew, Porter Instructor.</span><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">Valley of the Birdtail by Andrew Stobo Sniderman</font></strong><br /><span><font color="#2a2a2a">Divided by a beautiful valley and 150 years of racism, the town of Rossburn and the Waywayseecappo Indian reserve have been neighbours nearly as long as Canada has been a country.

Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.<br /><br />Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it&rsquo;s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.<br /><br /><em>Never Let Me Go</em> breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date.</span></font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">The Measure by Nikki Erlick&nbsp;</font></strong><br /><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">Eight ordinary people.

Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison.

Hunt</strong></font><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Born in 1934, Irmgard Hunt grew up in the Bavarian village of Berchtesgaden, in the shadow of the Eagle's Nest and near Adolf Hitler's luxurious alpine retreat. The very model of blond Aryan "purity," Irmgard sat on the F&uuml;hrer's knee for photographers, witnessed&nbsp;&nbsp;the comings and goings of all manner of famous personages, and with the blindness of a child accepted the Nazi doctrine that most of her family and everyone around her so embraced. She accepted the lies of her teachers and church and civic leaders, joined the Hitler Youth at age ten, and sang the songs extolling the virtues of National Socialism.<br /><br />But before the end -- when she and other children would be forced to cower in terror in dank bomb shelters and wartime deprivations would take a harrowing toll -- Irmgard's doubts about the "truths" she had been force-fed increased, fueled by the few brave souls who had not accepted Hitler and his abominations. After the fall of the brutal dictatorship and the suicide of its mad architect, many of her neighbors and loved ones still clung to their beliefs, prejudices, denial, and unacknowledged guilt. Irmgard, was determined to face the truth of her country's criminal past and to bear the responsibility for a reality that most of her elders were determined to forget. She resolved even then that the lessons of her youth would guide her actions and steel her commitment to defend the freedoms and democratic values that had been so easily dismissed by the German people.<br /><br />Provocative and astonishing, Irmgard A. Hunt's On Hitler's Mountain offers a unique, gripping, and vitally important first-person perspective on a tumultuous era in modern history, as viewed through the eyes of a child -- a candid and fascinating document, free of rationalization and whitewash, that chronicles the devastating moral collapse of a civilized nation.</font>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">Red Letter Days by Sarah-Jane Stratford</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Nineteen-fifties America is bright and full of promise, and Phoebe Adler, a New Yorker brimming with talent and ambition, is forging her way as the rarest of things: a female television writer in Hollywood.<br /><br />But fears of a growing Red Menace cloud the optimism, egged on by the hate-mongering of Senator McCarthy.

While her family was poor, their lives were rich in the ways that mattered most. Even at a young age, she had an innate sense of justice, which was reinforced by the lessons her parents taught her: Everyone deserves dignity. All people are equal. Those who work hard reap the rewards. Willful, spirited, and unusually intelligent, she discovered in Pincher Creek an extraordinary tapestry of people and perspectives that informed her worldview going forward.<br /><br />Still, life in the rural Prairies was lonely, and gaining access to education&mdash;especially for girls&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t always easy. As a young woman, McLachlin moved to Edmonton to pursue a degree in philosophy. There, she discovered her passion lay not in academia, but in the real world, solving problems directly related to the lives of the people around her. And in the law, she found the tools to do exactly that.<br /><br />She soon realized, though, that the world was not always willing to accept her. In her early years as an articling student and lawyer, she encountered sexism, exclusion, and old boys&rsquo; clubs at every turn. And outside the courtroom, personal loss and tragedies struck close to home. Nonetheless, McLachlin was determined to prove her worth, and her love of the law and the pursuit of justice pulled her through the darkest moments.<br /><br />McLachlin&rsquo;s meteoric rise through the courts soon found her serving on the highest court in the country, becoming the first woman to be named Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. She rapidly distinguished herself as a judge of renown, one who was never afraid to take on morally complex or charged debates. Over the next eighteen years, McLachlin presided over the most prominent cases in the country&mdash;involving Charter challenges, same-sex marriage, and euthanasia. One judgment at a time, she laid down a legal legacy that proved that fairness and justice were not luxuries of the powerful but rather obligations owed to each and every one of us.<br /><br />With warmth, honesty, and deep wisdom, McLachlin invites us into her legal and personal life&mdash;into the hopes and doubts, the triumphs and losses on and off the bench. Through it all, her constant faith in justice remained her true north. In an age of division and uncertainty, McLachlin&rsquo;s memoir is a reminder that justice and the rule of law remain our best hope for a progressive and bright future.</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmer</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">As a botanist, Robin Wall Kimmerer has been trained to ask questions of nature with the tools of science.

It just happened. Then the blindness goes viral. One by one, every man, woman and child is stricken by the syndrome; the victim sees not darkness, but a cloud of whiteness.<br /><br />In a panic, the government decides to quarantine anyone stricken with the blindness or who has had contact with a blind person.<br />&ldquo;Blindness isn&rsquo;t something that can be caught just by a blind man looking at some who is not. Blindness is a private matter between a person and the eyes with which he or she was born,&rdquo; writes Saramago.<br /><br />The main characters are identified simply as the first blind man, the doctor, his wife, the boy with the squint, the girl with dark glasses, the man with the black patch over his eye, and the other woman.<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;re so remote from the world that any day now, we shall no longer know who we are, or even remember our names,&rdquo; writes Saramago.<br />The group of seven discovers existing is a challenge with food, hygiene, and shelter becoming the focus in their quarantined lives.<br /><br />However, to the group of seven&rsquo;s advantage, the doctor&rsquo;s wife has not lost her sight. &ldquo;You do not know. You cannot know, what it is means to have eyes in a world in which everyone else is blind,&rdquo; the doctor&rsquo;s wife says as she struggles to help the group carry on.<br /><br />The dialogue among the group is phrased in allegorical double-meanings as they attempt to give a reason for their sudden blindness and pursue efforts to stay alive. &ldquo;The difficult thing isn&rsquo;t living with other people, it&rsquo;s understanding them,&rdquo; writes Saramago.<br />Eventually, the blindness spread throughout the entire city.<br /><br />Saramago describes the blind city-dwellers as &ldquo;simple, sexless forms, vague shapes, shadows losing themselves in the half-light. They fade into the surrounding light, and it is the light which does not allow them to see.&rdquo;<br /><br />Saramago uses metaphorical language. &ldquo;To be blind is not the same as being dead. Yes, but to be dead is to be blind.&rdquo; He is saying as long as a person is alive, they should strive for meaning, &ldquo;If we cannot live entirely like human beings, at least let us do everything in our power not to live entirely like animals.&rdquo;<br /><br />This novel is difficult to read and comprehend at some points; however, it grows on you as you learn how to live and understand what Blindness means. Interpreting the tragedy, Saramago writes, &ldquo;Illnesses may differ from one person to another, but what is really killing us now is blindness.&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;It even used to be said here is no such thing as blindness, only blind people. When the experience of time has taught us nothing other than that there are no blind people, but only blindness.&rdquo;</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">This is How it Always Is by Laurie Frankel</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">This is how a family keeps a secret&hellip;and how that secret ends up keeping them.<br /><br />This is how a family lives happily ever after&hellip;until happily ever after becomes complicated.<br /><br />This is how children change&hellip;and then change the world.<br /><br />This is Claude.

Now, one of the most innovative thinkers on the planet turns to the present to make sense of today's most pressing issues.</font><br /><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">How do computers and robots change the meaning of being human? How do we deal with the epidemic of fake news? Are nations and religions still relevant? What should we teach our children?</font><br /><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Yuval Noah Harari's 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is a probing and visionary investigation into today's most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive.</font><br /><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us? What will the future workforce look like, and how should we ready ourselves for it? How should we deal with the threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis?</font><br /><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Harari's unique ability to make sense of where we have come from and where we are going has captured the imaginations of millions of readers.

A war based upon a weapon, an Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP). A weapon that may already be in the hands of our enemies.<br /><br />Months before publication, One Second After has already been cited on the floor of Congress as a book all Americans should read, a book already being discussed in the corridors of the Pentagon as a truly realistic look at a weapon and its awesome power to destroy the entire United States, literally within one second. It is a weapon that the Wall Street Journal warns could shatter America. In the tradition of On the Beach, Fail Safe, and Testament, this book, set in a typical American town, is a dire warning of what might be our future ... and our end.</font><br /><br /><font color="#24678d"><strong>Becoming by Michelle Obama</strong></font><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era.

An accidental overdose in a state-of-the-art hospital. An overcooked holiday meal. At first glance, these disasters seem to have little in common. But surprising new research shows that all these events&ndash;and the myriad failures that dominate headlines every day&ndash;share similar causes. By understanding what lies behind these failures, we can design better systems, make our teams more productive, and transform how we make decisions at work and at home.</font><br /><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Weaving together cutting-edge social science with riveting stories that take us from the frontlines of the Volkswagen scandal to backstage at the Oscars, and from deep beneath the Gulf of Mexico to the top of Mount Everest, Chris Clearfield and Andr&aacute;s Tilcsik explain how the increasing complexity of our systems creates conditions ripe for failure and why our brains and teams can&rsquo;t keep up. They highlight the paradox of progress: Though modern systems have given us new capabilities, they&rsquo;ve become vulnerable to surprising meltdowns&ndash;and even to corruption and misconduct.</font><br /><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">But Meltdown isn&rsquo;t just about failure; it&rsquo;s about solutions&ndash;whether you&rsquo;re managing a team or the chaos of your family&rsquo;s morning routine. It reveals why ugly designs make us safer, how a five-minute exercise can prevent billion-dollar catastrophes, why teams with fewer experts are better at managing risk, and why diversity is one of our best safeguards against failure. The result is an eye-opening, empowering, and entirely original book&ndash;one that will change the way you see our complex world and your own place in it.</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">The Art of Racing in the Rain by Garth Stein</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Enzo knows he is different from other dogs: a philosopher with a nearly human soul (and an obsession with opposable thumbs), he has educated himself by watching television extensively, and by listening very closely to the words of his master, Denny Swift, an up-and-coming race car driver.<br /><br />Through Denny, Enzo has gained tremendous insight into the human condition, and he sees that life, like racing, isn't simply about going fast. Using the techniques needed on the race track, one can successfully navigate all of life's ordeals.<br /><br />On the eve of his death, Enzo takes stock of his life, recalling all that he and his family have been through: the sacrifices Denny has made to succeed professionally; the unexpected loss of Eve, Denny's wife; the three-year battle over their daughter, Zo&euml;, whose maternal grandparents pulled every string to gain custody. In the end, despite what he sees as his own limitations, Enzo comes through heroically to preserve the Swift family, holding in his heart the dream that Denny will become a racing champion with Zo&euml; at his side.&nbsp;<br /><br />Having learned what it takes to be a compassionate and successful person, the wise canine can barely wait until his next lifetime, when he is sure he will return as a man.</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">Enlightenment Now by Stephen Pinker</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Is the world really falling apart? Is the ideal of progress obsolete? In this elegant assessment of the human condition in the third millennium, cognitive scientist and public intellectual Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data: In seventy-five jaw-dropping graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing.<br /><br />Far from being a na&iuml;ve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human nature&ndash;tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinking&ndash;which demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation.&nbsp;<br /><br />With intellectual depth and literary flair, Enlightenment Now makes the case for reason, science, and humanism: the ideals we need to confront our problems and continue our progress.</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity by Katherine Boo</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">A landmark work of narrative nonfiction that tells the dramatic and sometimes heartbreaking story of families striving toward a better life in one of the twenty-first century's great, unequal cities.<br /><br />In this brilliantly written, fast-paced book, based on three years of uncompromising reporting, a bewildering age of global change and inequality is made human.&nbsp;<br /><br />Annawadi is a makeshift settlement in the shadow of luxury hotels near the Mumbai airport, and as India starts to prosper, Annawadians are electric with hope. Abdul, a reflective and enterprising Muslim teenager, sees "a fortune beyond counting" in the recyclable garbage that richer people throw away. Asha, a woman of formidable wit and deep scars from a childhood in rural poverty, has identified an alternate route to the middle class: political corruption. With a little luck, her sensitive, beautiful daughter - Annawadi's "most-everything girl" - will soon become its first female college graduate. And even the poorest Annawadians, like Kalu, a fifteen-year-old scrap-metal thief, believe themselves inching closer to the good lives and good times they call "the full enjoy."&nbsp;<br /><br />But then Abdul the garbage sorter is falsely accused in a shocking tragedy; terror and a global recession rock the city; and suppressed tensions over religion, caste, sex, power and economic envy turn brutal. As the tenderest individual hopes intersect with the greatest global truths, the true contours of a competitive age are revealed. And so, too, are the imaginations and courage of the people of Annawadi.&nbsp;<br /><br />With intelligence, humor, and deep insight into what connects human beings to one another in an era of tumultuous change, Behind the Beautiful Forevers carries the reader headlong into one of the twenty-first century's hidden worlds, and into the lives of people impossible to forget.&nbsp;</font><br /><br /><font color="#24678d"><strong>The Alice Network by Kate Quinn</strong></font><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">A female spy recruited to the real-life Alice Network in France during World War I and an unconventional American socialite searching for her cousin in 1947&mdash;are brought together in a mesmerizing story of courage and redemption.<br />1947.

How did a four-day battle at the midpoint of the Great War, a clash that had little strategic impact on the larger Allied war effort, become elevated to a national symbol of Canadian identity?<br /><br />Tim Cook, Canada's foremost military historian and a Charles Taylor Prize winner, examines the Battle of Vimy Ridge and the way the memory of it has evolved over 100 years. The operation that began April 9, 1917, was the first time the four divisions of the Canadian Corps fought together. More than 10,000 Canadian soldiers were killed or injured over four days--twice the casualty rate of the Dieppe Raid in August 1942.<br /><br />The Corps' victory solidified its reputation among allies and opponents as an elite fighting force. In the wars' aftermath, Vimy was chosen as the site for the country's strikingly beautiful monument to mark Canadian sacrifice and service. Over time, the legend of Vimy took on new meaning, with some calling it the "birth of the nation."<br /><br />The remarkable story of Vimy is a layered skein of facts, myths, wishful thinking, and conflicting narratives. Award-winning writer Tim Cook explores why the battle continues to resonate with Canadians a century later. He has uncovered fresh material and photographs from official archives and private collections across Canada and from around the world.<br /><br />On the 100th anniversary of the event, and as Canada celebrates 150 years as a country, Vimy is a fitting tribute to those who fought the country's defining battle. It is also a stirring account of Canadian identity and memory, told by a masterful storyteller.&nbsp; </font><br /><br /><strong><strong><font color="#24678d">History's People by Margaret MacMillan</font></strong></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">In History&rsquo;s People internationally acclaimed historian Margaret MacMillan gives her own personal selection of figures of the past, women and men, some famous and some little-known, who stand out for her.&nbsp; Some have changed the course of history and even directed the currents of their times.&nbsp; Others are memorable for being risk-takers, adventurers, or observers. &nbsp;<br /><br />She looks at the concept of leadership through Bismarck and the unification of Germany; William Lyon MacKenzie King and the preservation of the Canadian Federation; Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the bringing of a unified United States into the Second World War.&nbsp; She also notes how leaders can make huge and often destructive mistakes, as in the cases of Hitler, Stalin, and Thatcher. &nbsp;<br /><br />Richard Nixon and Samuel de Champlain are examples of daring risk-takers who stubbornly went their own ways, often in defiance of their own societies. &nbsp;<br /><br />Then there are the dreamers, explorers, and adventurers, individuals like Fanny Parkes and Elizabeth Simcoe who manage to defy or ignore the constraints of their own societies.<br /><br />Finally, there are the observers, such as Babur, the first Mughal emperor of India, and Victor Klemperer, a Holocaust survivor, who kept the notes and diaries that bring the past to life<span>.</span></font><br />&#8203;<br /><strong><strong><font color="#24678d">The Day the World Came to Town: 9/11 on Gander, Newfoundland by Jim DeFede</font></strong></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">When 38 jetliners bound for the United States were forced to land at Gander International Airport in Canada by the closing of U.S. airspace on September 11, the population of this small town on Newfoundland Island swelled from 10,300 to nearly 17,000. The citizens of Gander met the stranded passengers with an overwhelming display of friendship and goodwill. As the passengers stepped from the airplanes, exhausted, hungry and distraught after being held on board for nearly 24 hours while security checked all of the baggage, they were greeted with a feast prepared by the townspeople. Local bus drivers who had been on strike came off the picket lines to transport the passengers to the various shelters set up in local schools and churches. Linens and toiletries were bought and donated. A middle school provided showers, as well as access to computers, email, and televisions, allowing the passengers to stay in touch with family and follow the news.<br /><br />Over the course of those four days, many of the passengers developed friendships with Gander residents that they expect to last a lifetime. As a show of thanks, scholarship funds for the children of Gander have been formed and donations have been made to provide new computers for the schools. This book recounts the inspiring story of the residents of Gander, Canada, whose acts of kindness have touched the lives of thousands of people and been an example of humanity and goodwill<span>.</span></font><br />&#8203;<br /><strong><strong><font color="#24678d">The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah</font></strong></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Despite their differences, sisters Vianne and Isabelle have always been close.

Little personal information is exchanged, and neither woman has any way of knowing that they have produced what will become the most iconic image of the Great Depression.<br /><br />Three vibrant characters anchor the narrative of Mary Coin. Mary, the migrant mother herself, who emerges as a woman with deep reserves of courage and nerve, with private passions and carefully-guarded secrets. Vera Dare, the photographer wrestling with creative ambition who makes the choice to leave her children in order to pursue her work. And Walker Dodge, a present-day professor of cultural history, who discovers a family mystery embedded in the picture. In luminous, exquisitely rendered prose, Silver creates an extraordinary tale from a brief moment in history, and reminds us that although a great photograph can capture the essence of a moment, it only scratches the surface of a life.</font><br /><br /><strong><strong><font color="#24678d">The Right to be Cold by Sheila Watt-Clothier</font></strong></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a"><span>The Arctic ice is receding each year, but just as irreplaceable is the culture, the wisdom that has allowed the Inuit to thrive in the Far North for so long. And it's not just the Arctic. The whole world is changing in dangerous, unpredictable ways. Sheila Watt-Cloutier has devoted her life to protecting what is threatened and nurturing what has been wounded. In this culmination of Watt-Cloutier's regional, national, and international work over the last twenty-five years,<em> The Right to Be Cold </em>explores the parallels between safeguarding the Arctic and the survival of Inuit culture, of which her own background is such an extraordinary example.<br /><br />This is a human story of resilience, commitment, and survival told from the unique vantage point of an Inuk woman who, in spite of many obstacles, rose from humble beginnings in the Arctic to become one of the most influential and decorated environmental, cultural, and human rights advocates in the world.</span></font><br /><br /><strong><strong><font color="#24678d">Circling the Sun by Paula McLain</font></strong></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a"><span>Brought to Kenya from England as a child and then abandoned by her mother, Beryl is raised by both her father and the native Kipsigis tribe who share his estate.

Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical &ndash; and sometimes devastating &ndash; breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, palaeontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future.</font><br />&#8203;<br /><strong><strong><font color="#24678d">&#8203;</font><font color="#24678d">Precious Cargo by Craig Davidson</font></strong></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">In this new work of intimate, riveting and timely non-fiction, based loosely on a National Magazine Award-winning article he published in The Walrus, Davidson tells the story of one year in his life--a year during which he came to a new, mature understanding of his own life and his connection to others. Or, as Davidson would say, he became an adult.</font><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><font color="#2a2a2a">One morning in 2008, desperate and impoverished and living in a one-room basement apartment while trying unsuccessfully to write, Davidson plucked a flyer out of his mailbox that read, "Bus Drivers Wanted." That was the first step towards an unlikely new career: driving a school bus full of special-needs kids for a year. Armed only with a sense of humour akin to that of his charges, a creative approach to the challenge of driving a large, awkward vehicle while corralling a rowdy gang of kids, and surprising but unsentimental reserves of empathy, Davidson takes us along for the ride.<br /><br />&#8203;He shows us how his evolving relationship with the kids on that bus, each of them struggling physically as well as emotionally and socially, slowly but surely changed his life along with the lives of the "precious cargo" in his care. This is the extraordinary story of that year and those relationships. It is also a moving, important and universal story about how we see and treat people with special needs in our society.</font><br />&#8203;<br /><strong><strong><font color="#24678d">&#8203;</font><font color="#24678d">&#8203;Einstein: His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson</font></strong></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a"><span>Just recently, Gravitational Waves, ripples in space-time predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity 100 years ago, have finally been detected.</span><br /><br /><span>How did his mind work?

His fascinating story is a testament to the connection between creativity and freedom.</span><br /><br /><span>Based on newly released personal letters of Einstein, this book explores how an imaginative, impertinent patent clerk&mdash;a struggling father in a difficult marriage who couldn&rsquo;t get a teaching job or a doctorate&mdash;became the mind reader of the creator of the cosmos, the locksmith of the mysteries of the atom, and the universe. His success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marveling at mysteries that struck others as mundane.

They have one thing in common. Overnight, each novice investor lost his life's fortune to one man.&nbsp;<br /><br />The con: Harvey Metcalfe. A brilliant, self-made guru of deceit. A very dangerous individual. And now, a hunted man.&nbsp;<br /><br />With nothing left to lose four strangers are about to come together-each expert in their own field.

Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant-in the blink of an eye-that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of "blink": the election of Warren Harding; "New Coke"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of "thin-slicing"-filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind by William Kamkwamba</font>&nbsp;</strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">William Kamkwamba was born in Malawi, a country where magic ruled and modern science was mystery. It was also a land withered by drought and hunger. But William had read about windmills, and he dreamed of building one that would bring to his small village a set of luxuries that only 2 percent of Malawians could enjoy: electricity and running water. His neighbors called him misala&mdash;crazy&mdash;but William refused to let go of his dreams. With a small pile of once-forgotten science textbooks; some scrap metal, tractor parts, and bicycle halves; and an armory of curiosity and determination, he embarked on a daring plan to forge an unlikely contraption and small miracle that would change the lives around him.<br /><br />"The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind" is a remarkable true story about human inventiveness and its power to overcome crippling adversity. It will inspire anyone who doubts the power of one individual's ability to change his community and better the lives of those around him.</font><br /><br /><font color="#24678d"><strong>Pioneer Women - Suggested Books:</strong></font><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">Roughing it in the Bush by Susanna Moodie</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a"><em>Roughing it in the Bush</em>&nbsp;is the compelling true story of pioneer Susanna Moodie&rsquo;s experience immigrating to Canada with her sister, Catharine Parr Traill, in the 1830s.

Yet most of what we know of these two English gentlewomen who spent their adult lives struggling in Britain&rsquo;s harsh and vigorous colony comes from their own self-consciously crafted writings and from other writers&rsquo; sometimes fanciful depictions of them.

The Winter Palace tells the epic story of Catherine the Great's improbable rise to power--as seen through the ever-watchful eyes of an all-but-invisible servant close to the throne.<br /><br />Her name is Barbara--in Russian, Varvara. Nimble-witted and attentive, she's allowed into the employ of the Empress Elizabeth, amid the glitter and cruelty of the world's most eminent court. Under the tutelage of Count Bestuzhev, Chancellor and spymaster, Varvara will be educated in skills from lock picking to lovemaking, learning above all else to listen--and to wait for opportunity. That opportunity arrives in a slender young princess from Zerbst named Sophie, a playful teenager destined to become the indomitable Catherine the Great. Sophie's destiny at court is to marry the Empress's nephew, but she has other, loftier, more dangerous ambitions, and she proves to be more guileful than she first appears.<br /><br />What Sophie needs is an insider at court, a loyal pair of eyes and ears who knows the traps, the conspiracies, and the treacheries that surround her. Varvara will become Sophie's confidante--and together the two young women will rise to the pinnacle of absolute power.<br /><br />With dazzling details and intense drama, Eva Stachniak depicts Varvara's secret alliance with Catherine as the princess grows into a legend--through an enforced marriage, illicit seductions, and, at last, the shocking coup to assume the throne of all of Russia.<br /><br />Impeccably researched and magnificently written, The Winter Palace is an irresistible peek through the keyhole of one of history's grandest tales.<br /><br />Eva Stachniak was born in Wroc&#322;aw, Poland, and came to Canada in 1981.

He is also a bon vivant, a compulsive gambler and an incorrigible womanizer. He is well accustomed to bribing a forever-changing list of government officials in order to maintain the elite status of the Chen Academy. He is fiercely proud of his Chinese heritage, and quick to spot the business opportunities rife in a divided country. He devotedly ignores all news of the fighting that swirls around him, choosing instead to read the faces of his opponents at high-stakes mahjong tables. But when his only son gets in trouble with the Vietnamese authorities, Percival faces the limits of his connections and wealth and is forced to send him away. In the loneliness that follows, Percival finds solace in Jacqueline, a beautiful woman of mixed French and Vietnamese heritage, and Laing Jai, a son born to them on the eve of the Tet offensive. Percival's new-found happiness is precarious, and as the complexities of war encroach further and further into his world, he must confront the tragedy of all he has refused to see.<br />&nbsp;<br />Blessed with intriguingly flawed characters moving through a richly drawn historical and physical landscape, The Headmaster's Wager is a riveting story of love, betrayal and sacrifice.</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">Exit Lines by Joan Barfoot</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">The Idyll Inn, the setting for Joan Barfoot&rsquo;s brilliant eleventh novel, Exit Lines, is a pastel-hued care facility designed for seniors &ldquo;with healthy incomes but varying hopes, despairs, abilities and deformities.&rdquo; In scathing detail, Barfoot describes the Idyll Inn&rsquo;s plastic plants, inoffensive art and pallid recreational activities, all familiar to any reader who has had occasion to visit such a place &mdash; or to live in one. Running the show (or so she thinks) is priggish administrator Annabelle Walker, charged with keeping the residents happy, or at least as happy as is required to keep a tidy profit flowing to far-away investors.<br /><br />But not all residents of the Idyll Inn choose to acquiesce. Sylvia Lodge, one of the Idyll Inn&rsquo;s first residents, prides herself on her steely backbone, despite crippling arthritis. Affluently widowed, she has selected the Idyll Inn as a less objectionable alternative to a perilous dwindling at home. She coolly refuses to be bossed, certainly not by Annabelle Walker (about whose family Sylvia keeps a dark secret), or by her estranged daughter, Nancy, from whom she keeps yet another, even more explosive, secret. Sylvia is determined to unapologetically lay claim to her lifetime&nbsp; of choices, responsibilities and blame, not yet aware that her icy solitude will shortly be broken by the company of three soon-to-be-intimate friends.<br /><br />Given the facility&rsquo;s small population, the Idyll Inn&rsquo;s new inhabitants are bound to have crossed paths. And indeed many have. Wheelchair-confined George Hammond, once a handsome shoe store&mdash;owner with a stay-at-home wife and adored daughter, long ago cupped Sylvia&rsquo;s feet in his hands and admired her well-formed calves. He has done far more with Greta Bauer, his former clerk, whose loneliness as a young immigrant widow with children rendered her available for a comfortable and seemingly uncomplicated affair. Now deposited under the same roof by absent children, the former lovers are in a position to reflect on the consequences of their choices.<br /><br />Completing the newly formed coterie of friends is tiny Ruth Friedman, a retired Children&rsquo;s Aid worker who keeps many of the city&rsquo;s darkest secrets, and whose passionate late-in-life marriage to fellow social worker Bernard did not include children of their own. Now also widowed, her grief unfathomably deep, she has taken to cheerfully reading horrifying news stories aloud to her new friends, who are soon to discover that these daily doses of gloom are less for their edification than they are in service of a desperate project for which Ruth needs their complicity.<br /><br />In the wryly funny and wholly compassionate Exit Lines, acclaimed author Joan Barfoot once again treats her readers to an intimate encounter with some fascinating characters engaged in the fight of their lives. Sylvia, George, Greta and Ruth are at times tender, angry, hilarious and deeply flawed, but always utterly and captivatingly human. How do we treat the elderly in our lives? How do we intend to grow old ourselves? Will we ever come to the end of longing? Exit Lines brings to the surface these and other fundamental questions about the nature of life, and its closing.</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells&mdash;taken without her knowledge&mdash;became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first &ldquo;immortal&rdquo; human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they&rsquo;d weigh more than 50 million metric tons&mdash;as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb&rsquo;s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.&nbsp;<br /><br />Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.<br /><br />Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the &ldquo;colored&rdquo; ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta&rsquo;s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia&mdash;a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo&mdash;to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.&nbsp;<br /><br />Henrietta&rsquo;s family did not learn of her &ldquo;immortality&rdquo; until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family&mdash;past and present&mdash;is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.&nbsp;<br /><br />Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family&mdash;especially Henrietta&rsquo;s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother&rsquo;s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn&rsquo;t her children afford health insurance?&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Paris, July 1942: Sarah, a ten year-old girl, is brutally arrested with her family by the French police in the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup, but not before she locks her younger brother in a cupboard in the family's apartment, thinking that she will be back within a few hours.<br /><br />Paris, May 2002: On Vel' d'Hiv's 60th anniversary, journalist Julia Jarmond is asked to write an article about this black day in France's past. Through her contemporary investigation, she stumbles onto a trail of long-hidden family secrets that connect her to Sarah. Julia finds herself compelled to retrace the girl's ordeal, from that terrible term in the Vel d'Hiv', to the camps, and beyond. As she probes into Sarah's past, she begins to question her own place in France, and to reevaluate her marriage and her life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Tatiana de Rosnay offers us a brilliantly subtle, compelling portrait of France under occupation and reveals the taboos and silence that surround this painful episode.</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">Salmon Fishing in the Yemen by Paul Torday</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">This is the story of Dr Alfred Jones, a fisheries scientist - for whom diary -notable events include the acquisition of a new electric toothbrush and getting his article on caddis fly larvae published in 'Trout and Salmon' - who finds himself reluctantly involved in a project to bring salmon fishing to the Highlands of the Yemen - a project that will change his life, and the course of British political history forever.

He&rsquo;s hopeless at reading social cues or expressing himself well to others, though he is brilliant in many ways. But he has a special focus on one subject&mdash;forensic analysis. A police scanner in his room clues him in to crime scenes, and he&rsquo;s always showing up and telling the cops what to do. And he&rsquo;s usually right.<br />But when Jacob&rsquo;s small hometown is rocked by a terrible murder, law enforcement comes to him. Jacob&rsquo;s behaviors are hallmark Asperger&rsquo;s, but they look a lot like guilt to the local police. Suddenly the Hunt family, who only want to fit in, are directly in the spotlight. For Jacob&rsquo;s mother, Emma, it&rsquo;s a brutal reminder of the intolerance and misunderstanding that always threaten her family. For his brother, Theo, it&rsquo;s another indication why nothing is normal because of Jacob.<br /><br />And over this small family, the soul-searing question looms: Did Jacob commit murder?</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">The 19th Wife by David Ebershoff</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Sweeping and lyrical, spellbinding and unforgettable, David Ebershoff&rsquo;s The 19th Wife combines epic historical fiction with a modern murder mystery to create a brilliant novel of literary suspense.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is 1875, and Ann Eliza Young has recently separated from her powerful husband, Brigham Young, prophet and leader of the Mormon Church.

But on his way to the Big Leagues, Ron stumbled, his dreams broken by drinking, drugs, and women. Then, on a winter night in 1982, not far from Ron's home, a young cocktail waitress named Debra Sue Carter was savagely murdered. The investigation led nowhere. Until, on the flimsiest evidence, it led to Ron Williamson. The washed-up small-town hero was charged, tried, and sentenced to death--in a trial littered with lying witnesses and tainted evidence that would shatter a man's already broken life...and let a true killer go free. Impeccably researched, grippingly told, filled with eleventh-hour drama, John Grisham's first work of nonfiction reads like a page-turning legal thriller. It is a book that will terrify anyone who believes in the presumption of innocence.</font><br /><br /><strong><strong><font color="#24678d">Saturday by Ian McEwan</font></strong></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">From the pen of a master &mdash; the #1 bestselling, Booker Prize&ndash;winning author of Atonement &mdash; comes an astonishing novel that captures the fine balance of happiness and the unforeseen threats that can destroy it.

But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.<br /><br />Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it&rsquo;s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.<br /><br /><em>Never Let Me Go</em> breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date.</span></font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">The Measure by Nikki Erlick&nbsp;</font></strong><br /><span style="color:rgb(30, 25, 21)">Eight ordinary people.

So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove's mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul.

Along the way he meets one character after another, each of whom unlocks his long-dormant spirit and sense of promise. Memories of his first dance with Maureen, his wedding day, his joy in fatherhood, come rushing back to him - allowing him to also reconcile the losses and the regrets.

Hunt</strong></font><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Born in 1934, Irmgard Hunt grew up in the Bavarian village of Berchtesgaden, in the shadow of the Eagle's Nest and near Adolf Hitler's luxurious alpine retreat. The very model of blond Aryan "purity," Irmgard sat on the F&uuml;hrer's knee for photographers, witnessed&nbsp;&nbsp;the comings and goings of all manner of famous personages, and with the blindness of a child accepted the Nazi doctrine that most of her family and everyone around her so embraced. She accepted the lies of her teachers and church and civic leaders, joined the Hitler Youth at age ten, and sang the songs extolling the virtues of National Socialism.<br /><br />But before the end -- when she and other children would be forced to cower in terror in dank bomb shelters and wartime deprivations would take a harrowing toll -- Irmgard's doubts about the "truths" she had been force-fed increased, fueled by the few brave souls who had not accepted Hitler and his abominations. After the fall of the brutal dictatorship and the suicide of its mad architect, many of her neighbors and loved ones still clung to their beliefs, prejudices, denial, and unacknowledged guilt. Irmgard, was determined to face the truth of her country's criminal past and to bear the responsibility for a reality that most of her elders were determined to forget. She resolved even then that the lessons of her youth would guide her actions and steel her commitment to defend the freedoms and democratic values that had been so easily dismissed by the German people.<br /><br />Provocative and astonishing, Irmgard A. Hunt's On Hitler's Mountain offers a unique, gripping, and vitally important first-person perspective on a tumultuous era in modern history, as viewed through the eyes of a child -- a candid and fascinating document, free of rationalization and whitewash, that chronicles the devastating moral collapse of a civilized nation.</font>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">Red Letter Days by Sarah-Jane Stratford</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Nineteen-fifties America is bright and full of promise, and Phoebe Adler, a New Yorker brimming with talent and ambition, is forging her way as the rarest of things: a female television writer in Hollywood.<br /><br />But fears of a growing Red Menace cloud the optimism, egged on by the hate-mongering of Senator McCarthy.

While her family was poor, their lives were rich in the ways that mattered most. Even at a young age, she had an innate sense of justice, which was reinforced by the lessons her parents taught her: Everyone deserves dignity. All people are equal. Those who work hard reap the rewards. Willful, spirited, and unusually intelligent, she discovered in Pincher Creek an extraordinary tapestry of people and perspectives that informed her worldview going forward.<br /><br />Still, life in the rural Prairies was lonely, and gaining access to education&mdash;especially for girls&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t always easy. As a young woman, McLachlin moved to Edmonton to pursue a degree in philosophy. There, she discovered her passion lay not in academia, but in the real world, solving problems directly related to the lives of the people around her. And in the law, she found the tools to do exactly that.<br /><br />She soon realized, though, that the world was not always willing to accept her. In her early years as an articling student and lawyer, she encountered sexism, exclusion, and old boys&rsquo; clubs at every turn. And outside the courtroom, personal loss and tragedies struck close to home. Nonetheless, McLachlin was determined to prove her worth, and her love of the law and the pursuit of justice pulled her through the darkest moments.<br /><br />McLachlin&rsquo;s meteoric rise through the courts soon found her serving on the highest court in the country, becoming the first woman to be named Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. She rapidly distinguished herself as a judge of renown, one who was never afraid to take on morally complex or charged debates. Over the next eighteen years, McLachlin presided over the most prominent cases in the country&mdash;involving Charter challenges, same-sex marriage, and euthanasia. One judgment at a time, she laid down a legal legacy that proved that fairness and justice were not luxuries of the powerful but rather obligations owed to each and every one of us.<br /><br />With warmth, honesty, and deep wisdom, McLachlin invites us into her legal and personal life&mdash;into the hopes and doubts, the triumphs and losses on and off the bench. Through it all, her constant faith in justice remained her true north.

In Braiding Sweetgrass, Kimmerer brings these two lenses of knowledge together to take us on &ldquo;a journey that is every bit as mythic as it is scientific, as sacred as it is historical, as clever as it is wise&rdquo;&nbsp;</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">Blindness by Jose Saramago</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Blindness takes on a wide-range of social ills: over-population, the government&rsquo;s apathy toward the middle class, the relationship between selfishness and power, and how individual shortsightedness clouds judgment.<br /><br />Nobel Prize winner for Literature, Jose Saramago uses the loss of sight as a metaphor to explain how the social order, if it is to survive, must be rooted in common sense.<br /><br />A random driver, stopped in the middle of traffic, becomes the first casualty of this unexplainable and sudden phenomenon.<br />His blindness makes no sense. It just happened. Then the blindness goes viral. One by one, every man, woman and child is stricken by the syndrome; the victim sees not darkness, but a cloud of whiteness.<br /><br />In a panic, the government decides to quarantine anyone stricken with the blindness or who has had contact with a blind person.<br />&ldquo;Blindness isn&rsquo;t something that can be caught just by a blind man looking at some who is not. Blindness is a private matter between a person and the eyes with which he or she was born,&rdquo; writes Saramago.<br /><br />The main characters are identified simply as the first blind man, the doctor, his wife, the boy with the squint, the girl with dark glasses, the man with the black patch over his eye, and the other woman.<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;re so remote from the world that any day now, we shall no longer know who we are, or even remember our names,&rdquo; writes Saramago.<br />The group of seven discovers existing is a challenge with food, hygiene, and shelter becoming the focus in their quarantined lives.<br /><br />However, to the group of seven&rsquo;s advantage, the doctor&rsquo;s wife has not lost her sight. &ldquo;You do not know. You cannot know, what it is means to have eyes in a world in which everyone else is blind,&rdquo; the doctor&rsquo;s wife says as she struggles to help the group carry on.<br /><br />The dialogue among the group is phrased in allegorical double-meanings as they attempt to give a reason for their sudden blindness and pursue efforts to stay alive. &ldquo;The difficult thing isn&rsquo;t living with other people, it&rsquo;s understanding them,&rdquo; writes Saramago.<br />Eventually, the blindness spread throughout the entire city.<br /><br />Saramago describes the blind city-dwellers as &ldquo;simple, sexless forms, vague shapes, shadows losing themselves in the half-light. They fade into the surrounding light, and it is the light which does not allow them to see.&rdquo;<br /><br />Saramago uses metaphorical language. &ldquo;To be blind is not the same as being dead. Yes, but to be dead is to be blind.&rdquo; He is saying as long as a person is alive, they should strive for meaning, &ldquo;If we cannot live entirely like human beings, at least let us do everything in our power not to live entirely like animals.&rdquo;<br /><br />This novel is difficult to read and comprehend at some points; however, it grows on you as you learn how to live and understand what Blindness means. Interpreting the tragedy, Saramago writes, &ldquo;Illnesses may differ from one person to another, but what is really killing us now is blindness.&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;It even used to be said here is no such thing as blindness, only blind people. When the experience of time has taught us nothing other than that there are no blind people, but only blindness.&rdquo;</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">This is How it Always Is by Laurie Frankel</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">This is how a family keeps a secret&hellip;and how that secret ends up keeping them.<br /><br />This is how a family lives happily ever after&hellip;until happily ever after becomes complicated.<br /><br />This is how children change&hellip;and then change the world.<br /><br />This is Claude.

Now, one of the most innovative thinkers on the planet turns to the present to make sense of today's most pressing issues.</font><br /><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">How do computers and robots change the meaning of being human? How do we deal with the epidemic of fake news? Are nations and religions still relevant? What should we teach our children?</font><br /><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Yuval Noah Harari's 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is a probing and visionary investigation into today's most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive.</font><br /><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us?

A weapon that may already be in the hands of our enemies.<br /><br />Months before publication, One Second After has already been cited on the floor of Congress as a book all Americans should read, a book already being discussed in the corridors of the Pentagon as a truly realistic look at a weapon and its awesome power to destroy the entire United States, literally within one second.

An accidental overdose in a state-of-the-art hospital. An overcooked holiday meal. At first glance, these disasters seem to have little in common. But surprising new research shows that all these events&ndash;and the myriad failures that dominate headlines every day&ndash;share similar causes. By understanding what lies behind these failures, we can design better systems, make our teams more productive, and transform how we make decisions at work and at home.</font><br /><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Weaving together cutting-edge social science with riveting stories that take us from the frontlines of the Volkswagen scandal to backstage at the Oscars, and from deep beneath the Gulf of Mexico to the top of Mount Everest, Chris Clearfield and Andr&aacute;s Tilcsik explain how the increasing complexity of our systems creates conditions ripe for failure and why our brains and teams can&rsquo;t keep up. They highlight the paradox of progress: Though modern systems have given us new capabilities, they&rsquo;ve become vulnerable to surprising meltdowns&ndash;and even to corruption and misconduct.</font><br /><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">But Meltdown isn&rsquo;t just about failure; it&rsquo;s about solutions&ndash;whether you&rsquo;re managing a team or the chaos of your family&rsquo;s morning routine. It reveals why ugly designs make us safer, how a five-minute exercise can prevent billion-dollar catastrophes, why teams with fewer experts are better at managing risk, and why diversity is one of our best safeguards against failure. The result is an eye-opening, empowering, and entirely original book&ndash;one that will change the way you see our complex world and your own place in it.</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">The Art of Racing in the Rain by Garth Stein</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Enzo knows he is different from other dogs: a philosopher with a nearly human soul (and an obsession with opposable thumbs), he has educated himself by watching television extensively, and by listening very closely to the words of his master, Denny Swift, an up-and-coming race car driver.<br /><br />Through Denny, Enzo has gained tremendous insight into the human condition, and he sees that life, like racing, isn't simply about going fast. Using the techniques needed on the race track, one can successfully navigate all of life's ordeals.<br /><br />On the eve of his death, Enzo takes stock of his life, recalling all that he and his family have been through: the sacrifices Denny has made to succeed professionally; the unexpected loss of Eve, Denny's wife; the three-year battle over their daughter, Zo&euml;, whose maternal grandparents pulled every string to gain custody. In the end, despite what he sees as his own limitations, Enzo comes through heroically to preserve the Swift family, holding in his heart the dream that Denny will become a racing champion with Zo&euml; at his side.&nbsp;<br /><br />Having learned what it takes to be a compassionate and successful person, the wise canine can barely wait until his next lifetime, when he is sure he will return as a man.</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">Enlightenment Now by Stephen Pinker</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">Is the world really falling apart? Is the ideal of progress obsolete? In this elegant assessment of the human condition in the third millennium, cognitive scientist and public intellectual Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data: In seventy-five jaw-dropping graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing.<br /><br />Far from being a na&iuml;ve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human nature&ndash;tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinking&ndash;which demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation.&nbsp;<br /><br />With intellectual depth and literary flair, Enlightenment Now makes the case for reason, science, and humanism: the ideals we need to confront our problems and continue our progress.</font><br /><br /><strong><font color="#24678d">Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity by Katherine Boo</font></strong><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">A landmark work of narrative nonfiction that tells the dramatic and sometimes heartbreaking story of families striving toward a better life in one of the twenty-first century's great, unequal cities.<br /><br />In this brilliantly written, fast-paced book, based on three years of uncompromising reporting, a bewildering age of global change and inequality is made human.&nbsp;<br /><br />Annawadi is a makeshift settlement in the shadow of luxury hotels near the Mumbai airport, and as India starts to prosper, Annawadians are electric with hope. Abdul, a reflective and enterprising Muslim teenager, sees "a fortune beyond counting" in the recyclable garbage that richer people throw away. Asha, a woman of formidable wit and deep scars from a childhood in rural poverty, has identified an alternate route to the middle class: political corruption. With a little luck, her sensitive, beautiful daughter - Annawadi's "most-everything girl" - will soon become its first female college graduate. And even the poorest Annawadians, like Kalu, a fifteen-year-old scrap-metal thief, believe themselves inching closer to the good lives and good times they call "the full enjoy."&nbsp;<br /><br />But then Abdul the garbage sorter is falsely accused in a shocking tragedy; terror and a global recession rock the city; and suppressed tensions over religion, caste, sex, power and economic envy turn brutal. As the tenderest individual hopes intersect with the greatest global truths, the true contours of a competitive age are revealed. And so, too, are the imaginations and courage of the people of Annawadi.&nbsp;<br /><br />With intelligence, humor, and deep insight into what connects human beings to one another in an era of tumultuous change, Behind the Beautiful Forevers carries the reader headlong into one of the twenty-first century's hidden worlds, and into the lives of people impossible to forget.&nbsp;</font><br /><br /><font color="#24678d"><strong>The Alice Network by Kate Quinn</strong></font><br /><font color="#2a2a2a">A female spy recruited to the real-life Alice Network in France during World War I and an unconventional American socialite searching for her cousin in 1947&mdash;are brought together in a mesmerizing story of courage and redemption.<br />1947.
